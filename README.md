# ml_az

ml_az is a repository to store my machine learning studies. I'm diving into this subject because I have a passion for machine learning and due to my final graduation project, which involves the use of computer vision and machine learning to detect abnormal human behavior in external security cameras.

To provide context for those not residing in Brazil, here in Brazil, houses often look like this:

 and many residences have cameras facing the street. The problem is that these cameras record any movement, quickly filling up hard drives. My goal is to record only abnormal behaviors, generate a report, and if possible, alert the homeowner.
 

## Objective

The main objective of ml_az is to study machine learning content.

## Features and Learnings

- Exploration of various machine learning algorithms.
